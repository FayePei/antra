Answer the following questions:
What is useState?
useState is a Hook in React that allows you to add state management to functional components. 
Before Hooks were introduced, state could only be managed in class components. useState returns an array with two elements:
 the current state value and a function to update that state.

What is props drilling and state lifting?
Props Drilling: This term refers to the process of passing data from one component to another through multiple levels of components. 
If you need to pass data from a top-level component to a deeply nested child component, 
you may need to pass it through several intermediate components, which can lead to a complex and less maintainable code structure.

State Lifting: This technique involves moving state to a common ancestor component when multiple components need to share the same state. 
The common ancestor manages the state and passes it down through props, ensuring a single source of truth for that state.

What is the ‘key’ attribute?
The key attribute in React is used to uniquely identify elements in a list. When rendering a list of items, 
React uses key to understand which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
This helps React to optimize the rendering process by only updating the necessary elements.

What is synthetic event?
Synthetic Events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the native browser events. 
They provide a consistent interface across different browsers and work in the same way as native events. 
Synthetic Events are used in React's event system to improve performance and provide consistent behavior.

What is virtual dom?
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept used by React to optimize the process of updating the browser's DOM. 
The VDOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. When a component's state changes, 
React creates a new VDOM representation, compares it with the previous VDOM, and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to 
update the real DOM. This process, known as reconciliation, makes updating the UI more efficient because only the necessary changes are made.
